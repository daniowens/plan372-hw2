3. Scores do vary by city. Angier had the lowest average score at 94.5 and New Hill had the highest average score at 99.75.

4. Inspection scores do vary by inspector. Thomas Jumalon gave out the lowest average score at 89 and James Smith gave out the highest average score at 99.

6. The scores for restaurants are actually the lowest rated facility, while catered elderly nutrition sites had the highest.
